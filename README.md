# jutils
jutils is a Java Utils library, that came to light because of reused code after combining multiple libraries.
For example the combination of Project Reactor along with VAVR 
it became clear that there was a need for functional utility methods like in 
[functional](src/main/java/com/marmoush/jutils/utils/functional) package 
    
You might look at jutils as a new reactive Guava like library but of course not as mature as Guava yet.
You can also look at it as a dumb of code that I see reused, and can be extracted and generalized, therefore it is opinionated indeed.
 
This library is on edge, breaking changes are bound to happen occasionally, and 
I'm not currently following the semantic versioning literally. 
As soon as it gets more stability and users (if you're using it, please star it) there will hopefully be less breaking changes.
